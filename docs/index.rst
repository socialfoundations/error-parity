Welcome to error-parity's documentation!
========================================

The :code:`error-parity` package allows you to easily achieve error-rate
fairness between societal groups.
It's compatible with any score-based predictor, and can map out all of its
attainable fairness-accuracy trade-offs.

Full code available on the `GitHub repository`_,
including various `jupyter notebook examples`_ .
