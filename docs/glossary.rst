Glossary
========

ROC
   Receiver Operating Characteristic; plots TPR vs. FPR as threshold varies.

ROC hull
   The convex hull of achievable ROC points; mixing thresholds (and randomized classifiers) realizes any point on the hull.

TPR / FNR
   True positive rate / false negative rate; ``FNR = 1 - TPR``.

FPR / TNR
   False positive rate / true negative rate; ``TNR = 1 - FPR``.

PPR
   Positive prediction rate; fraction of predictions that are positive.

Tolerance
   Maximum allowed disparity under a chosen fairness constraint.
